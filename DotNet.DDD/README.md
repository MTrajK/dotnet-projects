# DDD
A presentation that explains the DDD (Domain-Driven Design) fundamentals.\
In this presentation, an existing [.NET project](https://github.com/ardalis/pluralsight-ddd-fundamentals) can be used because DDD is for "complex" projects and a "complex" project will need to be created in order to show the examples (but that's no sense for 1 hour presentation). This .NET project is from a popular DDD [Plurasight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fundamentals-domain-driven-design).\
*Note: this isn't a .NET specific presentation. Any other DDD project can be used for the examples, no matter the technology.*

## Project structure
