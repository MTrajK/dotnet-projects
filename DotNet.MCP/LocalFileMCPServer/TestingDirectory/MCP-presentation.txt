Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools. It provides a universal interface that allows AI assistants like Claude to securely interact with various systems including databases, APIs, file systems, and business tools.

Key Benefits:
- Enables AI models to access real-time, contextual information
- Provides a secure and standardized way to integrate external tools
- Allows developers to build reusable integrations that work across different AI applications
- Supports both local and remote data sources

MCP acts as a bridge between AI models and the wider digital ecosystem, making AI assistants more capable and context-aware while maintaining security and control over data access.
